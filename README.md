## 🚀 For Users

### Installation

Install `leak-proof` as a development dependency in your project:

```bash
npm install leak-proof --save-dev
```

### Quick Start

1. **Initialize in your project:**
   ```bash
   npx leak-proof init
   ```
   This sets up the necessary Git hooks and configuring your project for safety.

2. **Commit as usual:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: amazing new feature"
   ```

3. **That's it!** 
   If you accidentally stage a file with secrets (like `.env` or a hardcoded API key), `leak-proof` will **block the commit** and show you exactly what needs to be fixed.

### How it Works
1. You run `npx leak-proof init`.
2. A `prepare` script is added to your `package.json`.
3. When your teammates pull the code and run `npm install`, the hooks are automatically set up for them too.
4. **Everyone is protected effectively immediately.** 🎉

## 🔍 Security Checks

### File Patterns Blocked
- `.env`
- `.env.local`, `.env.test`, `.env.production`, etc.

### Secrets Detected
- **AWS Access Keys**: `AKIA...`
- **Private Keys**: `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----`
- **Generic Secrets**: 
  - `api_key = "..."`
  - `auth_token: "..."`
  - `client_secret = "..."`

### 🚦 Bypassing Checks (False Positives)

Sometimes you need to commit a dummy key for testing purposes. You have two options:

**Force Commit (Emergency)**

If you need to bypass the entire hook for a specific commit:

```bash
git commit -m "fixing stuff" --no-verify
```

---

## 🗑️ Uninstalling

If you want to remove Leak-Proof from your project, run:

```bash
npx leak-proof remove
```

This cleans up the git hooks and removes the scripts from your package.json.
